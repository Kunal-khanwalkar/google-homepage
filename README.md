TheOdinProject HTML/CSS MiniProject

After completing this miniproject, I will be able to make basic to intermediate webpages using HTML and CSS. 
This is part of The Odin Project's Web Development 101 curriculum. 
(http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The project uses raw HTML and CSS for positioning and design. The webpage is static, non-responsive and doesn't function as it doesn't implements Javascript and lacks backend.
